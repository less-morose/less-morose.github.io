- Both the Wazuh and TheHive Managers are hosted in separate Digital Ocean Ubuntu Droplets (VMs).  
- The Wazuh Agent is used to aggregate logs collected with Sysmon to the Wazuh Manager. It's hosted on my main machine where I also access the cloud consoles from.  
- Wazuh is then configured to connect to the SOAR software, Shuffle, to automatically calculate the SHA256 hash from the mimikatz.exe alert to send to VirusTotal, generating an alert for TheHive, and sending a separate email for (theoretical) SOC Analysts  

## Installation/Configuration

### Firewall
![Desktop View](/assets/posts/SOARSIEM/digitaloceanFirewall.png){: w="200" .right }
Before initializing both the Wazuh and TheHive managers, by default port 22 (SSH) is open by default to allow remote connections by anyone. Obviously, for security reasons I need to restrict access to SSH or simply just close off the port to avoid scanners probing the droplets. I opted to just remove the option to connect via SSH and instead use the console provided by DigitalOcean. I also enabled all TCP/UDP connections from my public IP address for the Wazuh Agent to be able to communicate to/from the Wazuh Manager.

### Wazuh Agent

The Wazuh Manager has a very convenient way to setup the curl command to setup the Wazuh Agent. By selecting the OS version, and the IP address of the manager, it automatically creates a curl command and provides additional commands to start the service on the agent.  
```bash
curl -o wazuh-agent-4.7.5-1.x86_64.rpm https://packages.wazuh.com/4.x/yum/wazuh-agent-4.7.5-1.x86_64.rpm && sudo WAZUH_MANAGER='<public IP of Wazuh Manager>' WAZUH_AGENT_NAME='<Agent Name>' rpm -ihv wazuh-agent-4.7.5-1.x86_64.rpm
```
Below is the configured Windows 10 Wazuh Agent.  
![Desktop View](/assets/posts/SOARSIEM/wazuh-manager-agents.png)
_I named the agent, 'socforensicsincidentresponse' to remember the 'FIR' in 'DFIR' :)_  

Installing sysmon is even easier. By installing the the Sysmon service through the Microsoft Documentation, and a systemconfig.xml file offered through the GitHub linked in that documentation page.
```bash
.\Sysmon.exe -i sysmonconfig.xml
```
Under the 'ossec.conf' file under C:\Program Files (x86)\ossec-agent, I edited the already existing localfile header to the Sysmon file path (Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational) so that the Wazuh agent gets logs generated by Sysmon under the Log Analysis Section

### TheHive Manager

Following TheHive's installation/configuration steps through their [documentation](https://docs.strangebee.com/thehive/installation/step-by-step-installation-guide/), essentially it configures the Cassandra and ElasticSearch services to be able to communicate with TheHive Manager.

### Wazuh Manager

For testing purposes, all logs will be pushed to the Wazuh Manager whether it triggers an alert/rule or not. To do this, I must change certain settings within the ossec.conf file and the Filebeats service configuration file on the _Wazuh Manager_ to reflect this.
![Desktop View](/assets/posts/SOARSIEM/wazuh-manager-ossec.png)
_Underlined terms were originally 'no'_  
Logs are saved under /var/ossec/logs/archives . Because I am ingesting ALL logs rather than just alerts, I need to configure the Filebeat service to reflect that. Under /etc/filebeat/filebeat.yml there is an area to enable archives.
![Desktop View](/assets/posts/SOARSIEM/wazuh-manager-filebeats.png)
_Like before, underlined term was originally 'false'_  
On the Wazuh Manager GUI itself, I still need to define another index pattern that reflects the archives themselves.
![Desktop View](/assets/posts/SOARSIEM/wazuh-manager-index.png)
The index goes through Wazuh's files, within its archives, and the '**' at the end defines everything within said archives.  

## Detecting Mimikatz 
Now that the log ingestion is configured and ready to go, it is time to create a custom rule that detects specifically Mimikatz. Because all archies are ingested, I can select some random log to look at the attributes that Sysmon offers.
![Desktop View](/assets/posts/SOARSIEM/mimikatz-initial-log.png)
The attributes in particular that I focused on are
- data.win.eventdata.image
	- The rule that will be created proves that this can be _very_ easily spoofed
- data.win.system.eventID
	- an eventID of 1 represents Process Creation. In properly made rules, this attributed used in tandem with other events contribute to process lineage to give insights on how the potential malware works or vulnerabilities within the environment.
- data.win.eventdata.originalFileName 
	- This will be used to circumvent spoofing the data.win.eventdata.image name.
![Desktop View](/assets/posts/SOARSIEM/mimikatz-attributes.png)

### Rule Creation

After scouring the rule templates provided by Wazuh, I came across not only templates for Sysmon, but rules that follow common ways to lock against certain eventID 1 events.
![Desktop View](/assets/posts/SOARSIEM/mimikatz-rule-initial.png)
![Desktop View](/assets/posts/SOARSIEM/mimikatz-rule-final.png)  

I simply copy and pasted the existing rule and changed the following:
- __rule id__ ->  +1 of the pre-existing custom rule
- __level__ -> 'level' can go from 0-16. I made it 16 just for fun.
- __field__ -> Line 21 (dotted in picture) tracks mimikatz (not case sensitive indicated by '(?i)' in the originalFileName)
- __description__ -> Indicate that mimikatz is found on the user Agent
- __mitre__ -> To reflect "OS Credential Dumping" (T1003)  

### Rule Testing

Now, I can test my rule. 

On the Windows 10 Wazuh Agent, I installed mimikatz and changed the name of the executable and ran it.
![Desktop View](/assets/posts/SOARSIEM/mimikatz-rule-prerun.png)
![Desktop View](/assets/posts/SOARSIEM/mimikatz-rule-postrun.png)  
Note how the headers match the information I put into the rule, and how the image name does not match the originalFileName!

![Desktop View](/assets/posts/SOARSIEM/mimikatz-rule-subheader.png)

## Shuffle (SOAR) Automation

Now with the rule configured, for the sake of testing I can configure the Wazuh Manager to only push alerts with the Mimikatz Rule ID, 100002, to shuffle.
Following these steps within this [Wazuh blog,](https://wazuh.com/blog/integrating-wazuh-with-shuffle/) I can copy the following code block into the ossec.conf file within the Wazuh Manager and replace the appropriate data.
```bash
<integration>
  <name>shuffle</name>
  <hook_url>http://<YOUR_SHUFFLE_URL>/api/v1/hooks/<HOOK_ID></hook_url>
  <level>3</level>
  <alert_format>json</alert_format>
</integration>
```

### Shuffle Webhook URI

![Desktop View](/assets/posts/SOARSIEM/shuffle-inital-uri.png){: w="425" .right }
I then copy the Webhook URI provided from the Webhook App I added to the Shuffle workspace, replace the <hook_url>, and also replace the 'level' tag with the 'rule_id' tag with the Mimikatz Rule ID (100002), which is similar in formatting to the custom rule earlier.  

![Desktop View](/assets/posts/SOARSIEM/shuffle-wazuhman-url.png)  
To save the changes, I saved the ossec.conf file and restarted the service. Once that was done, I reran Mimikatz on the Wazuh Agent, and tested the workflow. If it worked, I would see the attributes I set within the Wazuh rule within Shuffle and I'd be able to take those attributes to be able to use them for the workflow.
![Desktop View](/assets/posts/SOARSIEM/shuffle-initial-run.png)  

### SHA256_Regex

Within the aforementioned attributes, Wazuh automatically calculates the MD5, SHA256, and Import hashes of the file.
![Desktop View](/assets/posts/SOARSIEM/shuffle-hash-attribute.png)  
However, Wazuh puts all of these hashes on the same variable. Looking through the apps, the only way to get one checksum from the line is Regex code within a Shuffle Tools app. I don't know how to code in Regex, so I asked ChatGPT to only get the SHA256 sum from the input.

### VirusTotal

![Desktop View](/assets/posts/SOARSIEM/shuffle-virustotal-2.png){: w="260" .right }
I set the SHA256_Regex output to the VirusTotal app, but first I had to set up the authentication process for it. I created an account to get an API key used to authenticate the app. Through this app, similar to getting the attributes from the Mimikatz rule trigger, I can see the amount of vendors that list the mimikatz.exe as malicious, and its overall reputation score.

### TheHive

Now to extend the workflow to create an alert on the TheHive manager. Before that, I need to create a new orginization, as well as two user accounts, one service account to establish the API key to connect to TheHive app, and the other one is a user account to receive the alerts I create and push through Shuffle. I used a pre-made profile which gives a variety positions. Note that in a real environment, this would be configured with the idea of least privilege, which is not a concern for this demo.
![Desktop View](/assets/posts/SOARSIEM/shuffle-thehive-org.png)
_'admin' organization is created by default. My Organization is the name I decided for mine._
![Desktop View](/assets/posts/SOARSIEM/shuffle-thehive-users.png){: .right }  
For the Analyst account, I made a password and once an alert is created and pushed by Shuffle, I would have logged into the account to see the user with the username 'myorganization@test.com'.
On the left below, these are the initial settings I had. Testing the workflow I ran into the following issue on the right.
![Desktop View](/assets/posts/SOARSIEM/shuffle-thehive-initial-settings.png){: w="" .left } 
![Desktop View](/assets/posts/SOARSIEM/shuffle-thehive-initial-error.png){: w="400" .left }  
<br> Looking for solutions, I browsed through the other settings and switched to the advanced tab which is all the inputs but formatted in JSON. This was a long and arduous process. I had to trial and error and figured out through searching up the error codes from TheHive app that they have documentation on required fields and their type of inputs [here.](https://docs.strangebee.com/thehive/api-docs/#tag/Alert/operation/Create%)  

![Desktop View](/assets/posts/SOARSIEM/shuffle-thehive-initial-body.png)
_Initial json_
![Desktop View](/assets/posts/SOARSIEM/shuffle-thehive-final-body.png)
_Final json_
Running the workflow then logging into the Analyst user account on My Organization on TheHive website, it works!

### Email Alerts

![Desktop View](/assets/posts/SOARSIEM/shuffle-email-attribute.png){: w="200" .right }  
This portion was the easiest. 3 easy-to-fill fields and I used the same attributes used within TheHive app configuration. I assume for Google or Outlook addresses there would have to be extra authentication. The follow are successful runs of not only the workflow, but the temporary email receiving it as well.
